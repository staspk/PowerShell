Search: "Manage app execution aliases" -> {
    Was sent here by the new Python Install Manager on 11/4/2025,
        with the implication I can be flexible with console aliases like "py" (an apparently "old" alias, but my go-to on windows because of Python Launcher)
    But there are only on/off sliders?
    Promise was wonderful, actual experience terrible so far.

    Conclusion:
        uninstalled Python Install Manager
        used old direct version installer (but that will be deprecated as of Python3.15)

        Am I going to need to learn this?
